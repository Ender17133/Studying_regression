# Imaginary Data Analysis/Business Analytics task 

by: Beibarys Nyussupov 

A marketing professor is interested in the relationship between hours spent studying and total
points earned in a course. Data collected on students who took the course last semester are
provided in the file [MktHrsPts-S24.xlsx](https://github.com/Ender17133/Studying_regression/blob/main/MktHrsPts-S24.xlsx).
a. Develop an estimated regression equation showing how total points earned is related to
hours spent studying. What is the estimated regression model?
b. Test whether each of the regression parameters ùõΩ0 and ùõΩ1 is equal to zero at a 0.01 level
of significance. What are the correct interpretations of the estimated regression
parameters? Are these interpretations reasonable?
c. How much of the variation in the sample values of total point earned does the model you
estimated in part a explain?
d. Mark Sweeney spent 85 hours studying. Use the regression model you estimated in part
a to predict the total points Mark earned.
